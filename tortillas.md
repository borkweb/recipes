# Flour Tortillas

<img src="/img/tortillas.jpg" width="250"/>

Makes 8-10 tortillas depending on the size.

While my ingredients are slightly different, the dough texture and the technique is well represented in [this video](https://youtu.be/BSQNPWi-zxc?si=UnYqbLjMvtukzTwz).

## Incredients

* 2 cups white all-purpose flour (plus more for rolling and if dough is too sticky)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup lard (plus a bit extra for covering dough)
* 1 cup hot (not boiling) water

  ## Directions

  1. Whisk together dry ingredients in a large bowl
  2. Add lard in spoonfuls and cut into the dry ingredients until the dry ingredients look like coarse cumbs
  3. Slowly pour in the water and stir to bring the mixture together
  4. Knead the dough (in the bowl if you want to avoid a bigger mess) about 30-40 times until it becomes less sicky (though it should be slightly wet)
  5. Spread a very light coat of lard over the top of the dough with your hands to avoid it drying out
  6. Cover the bowl with a moist towel and let sit for about 15-30 minutes
  7. Separate into ping-pong ball sized portions.
  8. Spread a very light coat of lard over the top of the balls to avoid them drying out while you make the tortillas
  9. Put some flour in a bowl.
  10. Heat a large cast iron skillet to medium-high heat (don't try to cook tortillas until thoroughly heated)
  11. Take one of the balls and dip it in the bowl flour.
  12. Take the ball and flatten it in your hands slightly, making it slightly concave on the bottom
  13. Dust your counter and rolling pin with flour
  14. Put the ball (or pre-flattened dough) on the counter with the concave section down. Roll the ball very flat - the tortilla should be somewhat transparent when you peel it from the counter. If you are right handed, drape the tortilla on your left hand and use your right hand to round it out.
  15. Place tortilla on hot surface and watch in joy as it bubbles up. After about 12 seconds or so, flip the tortilla and cook for another 12-15 seconds. The tortilla should have some brown-ish spots but shouldn't be all brown.
  16. Wrap cooked tortillas in a towel as you go.
  17. Repeat steps 11-16

Use to wrap up meat, beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, etc. Or eggs. Or whatever! Tastes great with melted butter or melted butter and cheese.
